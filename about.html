<p>I finished my bachelor's degree in information technology with a specialization in programming from <a href="http://westerdals.no">Westerdals Oslo School of Arts, Communication and Technology</a> in 2016. I currently work as a <i>security operations consultant</i> in Norway.</p>
<p>
  I have a strong passion for information security, and spends most of my time keeping up to date with the security-world, and doing independent research around the subject.</p>
<p>
  I have found security vulnerabilities in several large websites and applications, and try as much as possible to share my findings (responsibly) here on this blog.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions or would like to contact me, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Mrtn9">Twitter</a>, <a href="{{site.linkedin_username}}">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">martin@ingesen.no</a>.

<p>
  Best regards,<br> Martin Ingesen
