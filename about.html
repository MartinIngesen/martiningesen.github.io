</p>

<p>
  I have a bachelor's degree in information technology with a specialization in programming from <a href="http://westerdals.no">Westerdals Oslo School of Arts, Communication and Technology</a>, and is currently do a part time master's degree in information security at <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu">NTNU</a>, on the Digital Forensics track.
